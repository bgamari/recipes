German Cheesecake
===================

Shoppinglist
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- half pint heavy cream
- 1.5 lb (or 500g) quark (*) or joghurt
- Cornstarch
- canned peaches or apricots in sirup (2 medium cans)
- 7oz (200g) of Graham crackers, Butterkeks, or other dry cookies

Tools
- large baking pan
- whisk
- electric mixer (or very strong arms)


(*) Called Topfen in Austria, or Fromage Blanc in France. If you happen to live in a country where you can't buy Quark, you can either use joghurt, or make it yourself (see my other recipes)
==============

1. Preheat the oven to 300 F (150 C)

2. separate 3 eggs into egg yolks and egg whites

3. In a Bowl, mix with whisk:
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 cup sugar
- a bit of cream
.. until sugar dissolves and everything gets foamy

4. In a separate cup, mix
- 1.5 table spoons of corn starch
- a bit of milk or cream
.. until corn starch dissolves and you have a smooth liquid

5. To the bowl, add
- dissolved corn starch
- the quark or yoghurt
.. and stir well

6. open canned peaches/apricots and drain off the liquid


7. in the cake pan:
- spread 2 table spoons of vegetable oil (or liquid butter)
- take 7oz of graham crackers (or other cookies), crumble into chunks to cover the bottom of the cake pan

6. in a new bowl, mix
- 3 egg whites
- a bit of salt
... whip with electric mixer until you get a stiff foam with (we aim for a shampoo-like texture, such as used in Merengues)


9. Wait until oven finished preheating

10. "Fold" the beaten egg whites into the bowl with quark-yolks-sugar-mixture. That means you pour the egg white foam into the bowl, and with a big spoon (not the whisk!) lightly mix with the quark mixture, trying to not destroy the the foam texture of the egg whites. 
If you mess it up, no problem, the cake will just be less fluffy

11. pour the mixture into the cake pan (on the cookie crumbles)
12. put peaches and apricots on top (they will sink in)
13. put in oven, and bake for 60 minutes (300 F)

14. After 60 minutes, take cake out of oven and let it cool down (maybe in front of an open window) for 30 minutes before you cut it.
Some people swear by refridgerating it for a few hours before cutting it (but I don't have the self control)


Cut and serve with whipped cream or fresh raspberries.
