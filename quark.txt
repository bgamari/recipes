Make your own Quark
===================


Quark is a kind of dairy very common in Germany. It is also known as Topfen in Austria or Fromage Blanc in France.

Unlike Mascarpone or sour cream, it is not very greasy. Some actually are very low in fat.

Unlike yoghurt, it does not curdle when in contact with hot acidic liquids (e.g. Tomato sauce).

It is the main ingredient in German Cheesecake, which is a very light and fluffy relative of the New York Cheesecake. It is also great with sugar and red currant, or with chives on cooked potatoes. You can also use it as spread.

It is really easy to make yourself, it just requires that you stay at home for a few hours.

Shopping List
(for 500g / 1.5 lb Quark)
- 2 quarts (2 liters) of butter milk (don't use the non-fat one)
- half a cup of half&half (or rich cream)

Tools
- large baking pan
- Cheese cloth (if you know what you are doing, you can also use paper towels)
- strainer
- a clean container with a tight lid or ball jar (I use an old joghurt container)

3 hours of time.

====================

1. pour 2 quarts of butter milk and a cup of half&half into the baking pan, and mix.

2. Put in oven, at 150F (60 C), for 2 hours


3. After 2 hours, let cool down at room temperature.

You will notice a cheese-like semi-solid carpet swimming on near transparent liquid.
The carpet is "the curds", the liquid is "whey".

4. Rinse the container and cheese cloth with very hot water.

5. Put the cheese cloth (or a layer of paper towls) in the strainer

6. With a spatula, shovel one portion of the curd-carpet off the pan and put it into the cloth.
Let it strain for a minute, lifting the cheese cloth up to help the straining, but don't wring it.
Then put portion into a clean container. Proceed until you got most of the carpet.

7. Then pour all remainders of the baking pan into the cheese cloth to get the last bit.


Refridgerated, the quark keeps for 3-5 days.

=====================

You may also save the whey for other purposes. Some people swear by mixing it with orange juice, other people use it when making bread dough.
